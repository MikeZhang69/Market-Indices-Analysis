## The Three Things to Remember

### 1. Time Beats Timing
- Nobody can consistently predict market ups and downs
- But EVERYONE can benefit from staying invested long-term

### 2. Crashes Are Temporary
- The 2008 Financial Crisis? Recovered.
- The 2000 Dot-com Bust? Recovered.
- The 2020 COVID Crash? Recovered in months.
- **Every major crash in history has been followed by recovery**

### 3. Start Now, Stay Long
- The best time to invest was 20 years ago
- The second best time is TODAY
- Every day you wait is a day of potential growth lost

## For Different Life Stages

### In Your 20s-30s?
→ Invest as much as you can. You have 30-40 years. Market crashes are SALES.

### In Your 40s-50s?
→ Keep investing. You still have 15-25 years. That's enough for near-certain gains.

### In Your 60s+?
→ Don't abandon stocks entirely. You might live another 20-30 years!

## The Bottom Line

> **Short-term: Gambling**
> **Long-term: Wealth Building**

If you can commit to 20 years, history shows you will almost certainly make money.

**Time is your superpower. Use it.**
